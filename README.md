# Mean-Centroid-Preddiff

## The open-source code for the paper 'A Trustworthy View on XAI Method Evaluation'.

Abstract: As the demand grows to develop end-user trust in AI models, practitioners start to build and configure customized XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) methods. The challenge is lack of systematic  evaluation of newly proposed XAI method. As a result, it limits the confidence of XAI explanation in practice. In this paper, we follow a process of XAI method development and define two metrics in terms of consistency and efficiency in guiding the evaluation of trustworthy explanation. We demonstrate the development of a new XAI method in feature interactions called Mean-Centroid Preddiff, which analyzes and explains the feature importance order by a clustering algorithm. 
Following the process, we perform cross-validation on Mean-Centroid Preddiff with existing XAI methods and show comparable consistency and gain in the computation efficiency. The practice helps to adopt the core activities in the trustworthy evaluation of a new XAI method with rigorous cross-validation on consistency and efficiency.

Appendix.pdf: A case study example and expeirment shows state-of-the-art XAI methods may not achieve consistency across the datasets and methods. This is a motivation to develop a new XAI method, Mean-Centroid Preddiff.
